# Telco_Customer_Churn_Project


Each row represents a customer, each column contains customerâ€™s attributes.

The raw data contains 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features).

The "Churn" column is our target.

We will try to estimate the target column "Churn" and will use classification metrics when evaluating the performance of our model!
